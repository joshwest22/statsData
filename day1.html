<h3>Create a function to get the grade from a quiz object
</h3>
    <p>We called our identifier "getGrade". We called our parameter quiz and returned the grade attribute of the object quiz.</p>
<pre>
 var getGrade = function(quiz)
 {
    return quiz.grade;
 }
    
var answer=getGrade; 
 </pre>   
</p>
<p>
<p>We called our identifier "getMean" because we were trying to get the mean of all the quizzes. We went to the first penguin and then its quizzes and then used our previous function to get the grades. Then we used d3.mean to get the mean of those grades.</p>
<pre>
var getMean= d3.mean(classroom[0].quizes.map(getGrade));
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<p>We called identifier answer and we called the funtion parameter "penguin". We wanted to return the mean of all the quiz grades from a given penguin.</p>
<pre>
var answer= function(penguin)
{ 
    return d3.mean(penguin.quizes.map(getGrade));
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<p>We called our identifier answer and we used the function from the previous question to get the mean of each penguin.</p>
<pre>
var getEachScore= classroom.map(answer);
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<p>We found the mean of all of the penguins quiz scores by using the function from the previous question in combination with d3.mean.</p>
<pre>
var classScore = d3.mean(getEachScore);
</pre>
