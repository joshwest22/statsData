<h3>Write a function that takes the classroom data and returns an array of objects.  Each object will have two attributes: a picture and the final grade in the class.</h3>
    
<pre>
var classView = function(penguin)
{
    var obj = {picture: penguin.picture,
               totalGrade: penguin.final[0].grade * .35
                + d3.mean(penguin.test, getGrade) * .3
                + d3.mean(penguin.quizes, getGrade) * .2 
                + d3.mean(penguin.homework, getGrade) * .15};
    return obj;
}
var overview = classroom.map(classView)
</pre>
</p>
<p>We used classroom.map to return an array of the results to our classView function. The classView function created and returned an object which contained a picture attribute and a totalGrade attribute.</p>
<p>We calculated the totalGrade by using d3.mean to find the average in a given category, then multiplied the result by the given weight, then added those all together.</p>
<h3>Write a function to find the average grade of all students on the first quiz.</h3>
